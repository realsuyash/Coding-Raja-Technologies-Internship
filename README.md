Description: Develop an image classification model to recognize different types of food items from images.

Steps:
Data Collection: Collect a dataset of food images categorized into various classes.
Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and split data into training and testing sets.
Model Architecture: Choose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet.
Transfer Learning: Use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for your specific food classification task.
Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics on the test dataset.
Visualization: Visualize model predictions and explore misclassified images.

Tech Stack:
Python
Deep Learning frameworks 
Image processing libraries

Description: Build a sentiment analysis model to classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral.

Steps:
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of social media posts with labeled sentiments.
Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or a neural network.
Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
Deployment: Create a simple web interface where users can input their own text for sentiment analysis.
